Env vars should already be expanded
There should be a handler for individual commands

A pipeline is run on subshells while an individual command is run on the shell process.

Store pointer to current command

Precedence:
	0: < > << >>
	1: |
	2: || &&

While token stack has elements:
	If the token is a word:
		If the current command pointer is null:
			Create a new command pointer, push it to the output queue.
		Add to command arguments
	If the token is a redirect symbol:
		assert the next token is a word, adding the word to the redirect section of the command
	If the token is `|` `||` `&&`:
		If the operator stack has one of these operators already in it:
			Push all the operators with a precedence greater than or equal to the current operator onto the output queue
			Push the operator onto the operator stack
			Set the current command pointer to NULL
	If the token is `(`:
		Add the token to the operator stack
		Set current command pointer to NULL
	If the token is `)`:
		Push tokens from the operator stack until a left parentheses is found.
		Discard both parentheses
		Set the current command pointer to NULL
		If none are found:
			Syntax error

Once token stack is empty:
	Push elements from operator stack onto output queue.
	If a left parentheses is found:
		Syntax error


run:
	if the output queue is of size 1:
		run simple command in the current shell env
		done

	while the queue is not empty:
		If the token is a command
			Push token onto stack
		If the token is an operator
			Pop the required number of commands from the stack and evaluate
			If the required number of commands aren't available:
				Syntax error
